## üåü How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use issue templates** when available
3. **Provide detailed information**:
   - Operating system and version
   - Python version
   - PyTorch version
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Error messages and stack traces

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. **Check existing feature requests** to avoid duplicates
2. **Clearly describe the enhancement**:
   - Use case and motivation
   - Proposed solution
   - Alternative solutions considered
   - Impact on existing functionality

### Code Contributions

#### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lightweight-tomato.git
   cd lightweight-tomato
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements_balancing.txt
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Code Style and Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Code Formatting**: Use `black` for code formatting
- **Import Sorting**: Use `isort` for import organization
- **Linting**: Use `flake8` for code linting
- **Type Hints**: Add type hints where appropriate

```bash
# Format code
black src/ scripts/

# Sort imports
isort src/ scripts/

# Lint code
flake8 src/ scripts/
```

#### Testing

- **Write tests** for new functionality
- **Ensure existing tests pass**
- **Maintain test coverage** above 80%

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

#### Documentation

- **Update docstrings** for new functions and classes
- **Update README.md** if adding new features
- **Add examples** for new functionality
- **Update relevant documentation** in `docs/`

#### Commit Guidelines

Follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(distillation): add temperature scaling for knowledge distillation
fix(quantization): resolve INT8 quantization accuracy issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```
